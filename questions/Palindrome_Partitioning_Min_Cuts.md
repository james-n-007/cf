## Palindrome Partitioning Min Cuts

#### Problem Statement


Given a non-empty string, write a function that returns the minimum number of cuts needed to perform on the string such that each remaining substring is a
palindrome. A palindrome is dened as a string that is written the same forward as backward. Note that single-character strings are palindromes.

Sample input:"noonabbad"

Sample output: 2 ("noon | abba | d")
