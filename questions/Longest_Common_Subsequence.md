## Longest Common Subsequence

#### Problem Statement

Implement a function that returns the longest subsequence common to two given strings. A subsequence is dened as a group of characters that appear
sequentially, with no importance given to their actual position in a string. In other words, characters do not need to appear consecutively in order to form a
subsequence. Assume that there will only be one longest common subsequence.


`Sample input:"ZXVVYZW","XKYKZPW"
Sample output: ["X","Y","Z","W"]
`


#### Solution
