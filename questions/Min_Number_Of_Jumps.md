## Min Number Of Jumps

#### Problem Statement

Min Number Of Jumps
You are given a non-empty array of integers. Each element represents the maximum number of steps you can take forward. For example, if the element at index 1
is 3, you can go from index 1 to index 2, 3, or 4. Write a function that returns the minimum number of jumps needed to reach the nal index. Note that jumping
from index i to index i + x always constitutes 1 jump, no matter how large x is.


`Sample input: [3, 4, 2, 1, 2, 3, 7, 1, 1, 1, 3]
Sample output: 4 (3 --> 4 or 2 --> 2 or 3 --> 7 --> 3)`
